## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be the development of TheFamilyConnection.org.  This website will combine features of a high level genealogy application with the communications, blogging and event planning features of a social media application.  The inspiration for this site is that I created a website (www.kalaher.org) in 2001 showing birthdays and anniversaries for the descendants of my grandparents on my mother’s side.  The data is in an Access database that I export to create a table that is put into a static html page.  It was last updated in 2011 so is now several years out of date.  My mother recently asked if I could set her up a way to update the data (she will be my first administrator).  My family also uses a Facebook group for announcements and planning gatherings but less than half of the family is on Facebook.  This will provide another way to plan gatherings that can use e-mail and text notifications.

### Features
A few of the features of this project will be:
1) Administration: An administrative user will be created for a family tree and that user will be able to build the family tree and invite added users via email.
2) User Login: Users will be able to claim their account created by an administrator.  
3) User Profile Page: Users will have a profile page and will have the ability to update their information such as marriages, divorces, children, address, phone number, social media links, etc. (subject to administrator approval).
4) Events: Users will be able to post information about events (family reunions, etc.).
5) Interact with other Users:  Users will have the ability to contact other users with in-app direct messaging.  
6) Notifications: Users will be able to opt-in for email notifications.


These are longer term (icebox) features:
1) Explore Family Tree: Users will be able to explorer their family tree. 
2) Search:  Users will have the ability to search for other users in addition to the content of blog posts and events.
3) Create Post:  Users will be able to create new blog posts or comment on blog posts of others.
4) Event Planning: Users will be able to use event planning tools to plan events (reunions, weddings, etc.) or respond to events planned by others in their family tree.
5) Notifications:  Users will be able to opt-in for notification (push notifications, text, chrome notifications, etc.) for events or other important family information (death, birth, etc.).
6) Phone App:  Users will be able to install a phone app to implement these functions and interact with the site.
